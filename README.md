Hello to all! :)

Currently, I am pursuing a degree in computer science. I am working to create projects that I can upload here for collaborating and building my programming portfolio. 





- 🔭 I’m currently working on an algorithm for a programming project I would like to add here. I need to build my resume and showcase the skills I am learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java, python, sql, machine learning, anything and everything I can related to computer science.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I am very excited to learn and work on anything new. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with advice, knowledge, or anything that is helpful to know when breaking into the tech industry.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am studying my sixth spoken language. I speak English, German, Latin, Spanish, Turkish, and now I am studying Brazilian Portuguese.
